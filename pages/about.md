# **About Me**

<br>
Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, a rising second-year ECE master student at Duke University. <br><br>
:point_right: As a software engineer, I interned at Siemens (Corporate Technology) and an air force startup. I have deep computer science understanding in `data structure & algorithm`, as well as experience in `web development (Django, React.js, Node.js)`, `C++ & Java OO design`,  and `system programming (concurrency, synchronization, TCP socket)`. <br><br>
I have good time management and communication skills and I am :satisfied: to work in a deeply collaborative environment.
