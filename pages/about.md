# **About Me**
<br>
Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, a first-year ECE master student at Duke University. <br><br>
:point_right: I once interned at the Corporate Technology of SIEMENS as a Research and Development Intern. <br><br>
With a specialized track in software engineer :computer: , I have deep computer science understanding in `data structure and algorithm`, as well as experience in `C++ and Java OO design`, `system programming (concurrency, synchronization, TCP socket)` and `web-app development`. <br><br>
I have good time management and communication skills and I am :satisfied: to work in a deeply collaborative environment.<br>
