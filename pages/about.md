# **About Me**

<br>
Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, a second-year ECE master student at Duke University. I will graduate in May 2021 and I'm looking for a full-time software engineer position. <br><br>
:point_right: As a software engineer, I interned at Siemens (Corporate Technology) and EzTrain LLC (a defense&space startup).<br><br> 
I'm experienced in Java, Python, Javascript, Swift, C/C++. I have a good understanding in data structure & algorithm, as well as experience in web development (Django, Javascript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js), Mobile App Development(Swift, Xcode), C++ & Java OO design, and system programming (concurrency, synchronization, TCP socket). <br><br>
I have good time management and communication skills and I am :satisfied: to work in a deeply collaborative environment.
